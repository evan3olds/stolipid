## Phase 1 — Foundation ✓

**Status:** Complete

### Frontend scaffold created

- `index.html` — shell HTML with Google Fonts (IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Mono, Newsreader) and a `<div id="app">` mount point
- `style.css` — Paper theme CSS tokens (`--bg`, `--accent`, `--font-body`, `--font-mono`, `--font-heading`) and base resets
- `app.js` — `RENDER_API_URL` constant and `api()` fetch helper that attaches a Bearer token from `localStorage` on every request; empty `navigate()` skeleton

### Architecture decisions locked in

- The frontend calls Render's API only — no Supabase JS client in the browser
- Render (Python) is the sole service that reads/writes Supabase
- Supabase schema, RLS policies, and storage setup belong in the Render/Python repo, not here

### Verified

- `index.html` opens in browser with no console errors
- No Supabase CDN script present in the page source

## Phase 2 — Auth ✓

**Status:** Complete

### Login screen built

- `app.js` — `renderLogin()` renders the login card (eyebrow, heading, username/password fields, submit button, error area) and wires the form submit handler
- `app.js` — `renderExperimentsStub()` renders a placeholder shell with a "Log out" link, standing in for Phase 4's real Experiments screen
- `app.js` — `navigate()` now routes between `'login'` and `'experiments'`; on boot, checks `localStorage.getItem('token')` to decide which screen to show first
- `style.css` — added `.login-screen`, `.login-card`, `.login-field`, `.login-submit`, `.login-error`, and `.app-shell` styles in the Paper theme

### Auth flow

- Login submits to `api('/auth/login', { method: 'POST', body: { username, password } })` — reuses the existing Render `api()` helper unchanged
- On success: stores `{ token }` in `localStorage`, navigates to the Experiments stub
- On failure: displays "Login failed. Check your username and password." in the error area
- Logout clears the stored token and returns to the login screen
- Added `POST /auth/login` to `tasks.md` Phase 11 — this endpoint doesn't exist on the Render side yet, so login will fail against the real backend until it's built

### Verified

- Login screen renders correctly (Paper theme colors, fonts, layout) — confirmed via headless Chrome screenshot
- Submitting credentials against the still-placeholder `RENDER_API_URL` fails as expected and shows the inline error message
- Pre-setting a token in `localStorage` and reloading skips the login screen and shows the Experiments stub
- Logout clears the token and returns to the login screen
- Empty-field submission is blocked by native HTML `required` validation before it reaches `api()`
