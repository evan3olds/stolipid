# Activity Log

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✓

**Status:** Complete

### Frontend scaffold created

- `index.html` — shell HTML with Google Fonts (IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Mono, Newsreader) and a `<div id="app">` mount point
- `style.css` — Paper theme CSS tokens (`--bg`, `--accent`, `--font-body`, `--font-mono`, `--font-heading`) and base resets
- `app.js` — `RENDER_API_URL` constant and `api()` fetch helper that attaches a Bearer token from `localStorage` on every request; empty `navigate()` skeleton

### Architecture decisions locked in

- The frontend calls Render's API only — no Supabase JS client in the browser
- Render (Python) is the sole service that reads/writes Supabase
- Supabase schema, RLS policies, and storage setup belong in the Render/Python repo, not here

### Verified

- `index.html` opens in browser with no console errors
- No Supabase CDN script present in the page source

## Phase 2 — Auth ✓

**Status:** Complete

### Login screen built

- `app.js` — `renderLogin()` renders the login card (eyebrow, heading, username/password fields, submit button, error area) and wires the form submit handler
- `app.js` — `renderExperimentsStub()` renders a placeholder shell with a "Log out" link, standing in for Phase 4's real Experiments screen
- `app.js` — `navigate()` now routes between `'login'` and `'experiments'`; on boot, checks `localStorage.getItem('token')` to decide which screen to show first
- `style.css` — added `.login-screen`, `.login-card`, `.login-field`, `.login-submit`, `.login-error`, and `.app-shell` styles in the Paper theme

### Auth flow

- Login submits to `api('/auth/login', { method: 'POST', body: { username, password } })` — reuses the existing Render `api()` helper unchanged
- On success: stores `{ token }` in `localStorage`, navigates to the Experiments stub
- On failure: displays "Login failed. Check your username and password." in the error area
- Logout clears the stored token and returns to the login screen
- Added `POST /auth/login` to `tasks.md` Phase 11 — this endpoint doesn't exist on the Render side yet, so login will fail against the real backend until it's built

### Verified

- Login screen renders correctly (Paper theme colors, fonts, layout) — confirmed via headless Chrome screenshot
- Submitting credentials against the still-placeholder `RENDER_API_URL` fails as expected and shows the inline error message
- Pre-setting a token in `localStorage` and reloading skips the login screen and shows the Experiments stub
- Logout clears the token and returns to the login screen
- Empty-field submission is blocked by native HTML `required` validation before it reaches `api()`

## Phase 3 — Core Navigation ✓

**Status:** Complete (chrome only — Experiments/Graph/Raw Data/About/Help remain stubs pending their own phases)

### Persistent authenticated shell built

- `app.js` — introduced a `state` object (`{ screen, experiment, condition }`), a `CONFIG` props holder (`appTitle`, `prototypeBadge`), a `SCREENS` metadata map (per-screen title / primary-action label / back-button flag), and a `NAV_LINKS` list for the drawer
- `app.js` — reworked `navigate(screen, params)` to update `state` then dispatch: `login` renders the bare login card; all other screens render through `renderShell()`, which swaps only the content region while the chrome persists
- `app.js` — `renderShell()` composes `topbarHTML()`, `subheaderHTML()`, a content `screenStub()`, and `sidebarHTML()`, then wires events in `wireShell()`
- `app.js` — removed the old `renderExperimentsStub()`; the generic `screenStub()` now backs every not-yet-built screen
- `style.css` — replaced the temporary `.app-shell` styles with full shell chrome (`.topbar`, `.badge`, `.avatar`, `.hamburger`, `.subheader`, `.breadcrumb`/`.crumb`, `.primary-action`, `.back-btn`, `.content`, and the `.sidebar`/`.sidebar-backdrop` drawer with a `translateX` slide transition)

### Chrome behavior

- **Top bar:** app title from `CONFIG.appTitle`, "Prototype" badge (toggled by `CONFIG.prototypeBadge`), hamburger button, and a user-avatar circle showing the logged-in user's initial (parsed from the stored token)
- **Sidebar drawer:** slides in over a translucent backdrop; links route via `navigate()` and close the drawer; backdrop click and Esc also close it. The Esc handler lives on `document` and is detached before each re-render to avoid accumulation. Active screen is highlighted
- **Subheader:** breadcrumb built from `state` (`Experiments` → experiment → condition), with earlier crumbs clickable to navigate up; right-aligned primary action button whose label is context-sensitive per screen (no-op handlers this phase — real behavior lands with each screen's phase)
- **Back button:** rendered only on Conditions and Cells screens; steps one level up the hierarchy (Cells → Conditions → Experiments)

### Verified

- Headless-Chrome screenshots (temporary `_verify.html` harness, since removed): the Experiments shell renders correctly in the Paper theme — top bar, breadcrumb, "Add experiment" action, content stub
- Deep-screen check: navigating to Cells with a seeded experiment/condition shows the full breadcrumb and "Add photos" action; opening the drawer dims the backdrop and lists all five nav links plus Log out
- Fixed a layout bug found during verification — sidebar nav links flowed inline and wrapped; added `flex-direction: column` to `.sidebar-nav` so they stack
